# Spotify_PredictingLeadingArtists

## Introduction
This project aims to leverage data to predict artist success on Spotify, understand the factors that contribute to it, and understand how Spotify playlists play a part in it. Spotify has changed the music landscape recently, and provides a platform for new artists to showcase their work and introduce themselves to the world. As a musician myself, ABRSM educated in theory and piano, I was very excited to do this analysis. 

## Acknowledgements
The opportunity to do this analysis was provided by UCL, as this rich dataset of 50 billion rows was given as a part of my MSc in Business Analytics. My analysis was particularly inspired by a dissertation whose author was made anonymous. The work investigates the role of Spotify playlists and makes use of Network Analysis as well. However, my work investigates the role of playlists and other factors by considering the aggregated audio and lyrical content of all the songs of the artist. 

## Dataset
The dataset covers songs played on Spotify by a particular user, where each row represents a song played for more than 30 seconds. As the dataset is very large, we have considered a sample of 3 million rows, due to constrained resources and time.
